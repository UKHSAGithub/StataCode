In stata the prefix ib#. means the variable is a factor and the baseline level is #
res:  0=control, 1=case
pos_prev:  previously positive at least 90 before current sample date (0=no, 1=yes)
hscw_esr_nims:  health care worker flag (0=no 1 = yes) 
carehome:   Geography NHS region (0=no 1=yes) carehome resident flag
nhsregion:  xxxx (coded as 1 to xx – however many there were)
cev_nims:   Clinically extremely vulnerable flag (0=no, 1=yes)
severelyimmunosuppressed:   Severely immunosuppressed flag  (0=no, 1=yes)
imd5: imd quintile (1 to 5 where 1 is most deprived)
eth1: ethnicity (baseline of 15 is white)
age5:  5 year age band (baseline of 15 is age 70-74)
risk_nims: “at risk” population flag  (0=no, 1=yes)
gender:  female, male (0=female, 1=male)
wk_onset: week of onset in 2021  (baseline week 40)
vacc_catb: vaccine variable (0=unvaccinated and is used a baseline for comparison to unvaccinated, other levels cover 175+ days post dose2 and all the post dose 3 intervals).

Note: this model was fitted separately for each booster vaccine and when assessing the relative VE unvaccinated were dropped the baseline was changed the appropriate comparator level for the vacc_catb factor. When assessing hospitalisations then this model is fitted to hospitalised cases and all controls.
